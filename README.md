# Pizza
As suggested by my colleague I'm creating a repository with my pizza recipe.

The recipe is created with heavy inspiration from:
- [https://youtu.be/7UB1saPQe-c](https://youtu.be/7UB1saPQe-c) which you will also find referenced below.

## Dough
The recipe includes sourdough, but in case you don't have sourdough and don't intend to create one, add a small bit of water.

### Ingredients
- Flour
  - 100g ølands wheat
  - 80g durum (semolina)
  - 50g regular wheat
  - 270g Tipo00 wheat
- 300g water at approximately 35 degrees Celsius
- 130g wheat sourdough
- Yeast. 5g for regular yeast/1g for dry-yeast.
- 20g salt
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp sugar

### Method
1. Measure and mix flour in on bowl.
2. Measyre and mix everything else in another bowl.
3. Gradually add the flour to the other bowl while stirring with a wooden spoon.
4. When the dough is coming together, continue kneading by hand by folding the dough over and over. If it feels wet, add some semolina flour. It should feel sticky at the end, but should come off the table and your hands. When you get tired, let the dough rest for 10 min. You will find that it softens up again.
5. Shape the dough into 4 balls of dough. Here is a video showing how you can do it [https://youtu.be/7UB1saPQe-c?t=597](https://youtu.be/7UB1saPQe-c?t=597)
6. Cover the dough in a closer atmosphere by wrapping them with plastic, or putting them in a container. You can also brush the top with olie-oil to prevent it from drying.
7. Leave the dough a couple of hours by room temperature, then refrigerate. Leave for 12-72 hours.
8. Take the dough out of the refrigerator a couple of hours before making the pizza.

### Making the pizza
1. Drissle some semolina flour on the table.
2. Push a dough ball flat. Continue making it thinner by pressin from the center out with your fingers. Whatch out not to press too hard on the outer part - you want a big and puffy crust!
3. Perhaps it is easier if you go back to the video and watch here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UB1saPQe-c&feature=youtu.be&t=950](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UB1saPQe-c&feature=youtu.be&t=950)

## Sauce
I usually use Mutti canned tomatoes. I chop two cloves of garlic and fry in a bit of olive oil before adding salt and pepper and then a can of tomatoes.
